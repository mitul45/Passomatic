Passomatic
==========

Swipe badge to login.

A utility developed as part of Hackathon to allow user to login to their system without entering credentials. It uses RFID on your badge to detect you and once its successful, the system will log you into your computer.

This project requires Arduino and an RFID reader to parse your badge's data.
